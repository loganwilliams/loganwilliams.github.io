      "With ongoing environmental degradation at local, regional, and global
      scales, people's accepted thresholds for environmental conditions are
      continually being lowered. In the absence of past information or
      experience with historical conditions, members of each new generation
      accept the situation in which they were raised as being normal."

      The research on the “shifting baseline” problem is surprisingly young —
      two oft-cited papers at the forefront of describing the issue were
      published in 1995.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent papers also suggest ways to fix the baseline in place: observation,
      measurement, and communication.

      I built a water-monitoring station for Glen Echo Creek, the small urban
      stream flowing beside my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it sat, a depth sensing strip hanging a few centimeters in the water
      like a citizen scientist's toe, while I tried to decide why and for what I
      had built it.

      The visualization accompanying this text shows its complete output:
      several months of water and atmospheric observations, recorded with
      intermittent consistency and accuracy.

      I wish I could explain how it feels to read Muir, listen to the Sierra
      stories of my uncle, or even read a BackpackingLite forum post from 2006.
      It's a shameful kind of jealousy and sadness and anger. Knowing that these
      experiences of isolation, wildlife, and discovery are gone now.

      To know that ducks over the Central Valley could blot out the sky at
      sunset; to learn that insects have lost 70% of their population; to hear of cities
    that were meadows not 100 years ago but 40 years ago; to imagine bears
      roaming the grasslands off that sick joke, Grizzly Peak.

      One morning, woken by a tempestuous pattering and grimacing against a
      horizontal deluge, I spotted the sensor awash downstream, dangling from a
      CAT5 cable.

      The creek didn't always have behave so ferociously, of course. And to a
      signficant degree, that was
      <em>why</em> I was doing this &mdash; the possibility of connecting to
      something greater than me in space and time.

      And the rains did bring some welcome and unexpected moments of suprising
      connection among the chaos. A river otter began to frequent the creek,
      spending several months intermittently appearing in the night &mdash;
      perhaps using the creek as a corridor between Lake Temescal and the bay.

      I cling to this echo, but must resist the temptation to claim this
      mangled, distorted and subdued replication as the thing itself. I must
      resist this misrepresentation as equally in the Sierra as I do at our
      creek.
    </p>

      The only thing worse than claiming wildness exists is claiming
      <em>wildness</em> exists.

      In the end, it was neither nearly being washed away, nor the flooding from
      tupperware's predictable vincibility to the drumbeat persistance of an
      atmospheric river that ended the sensor.

      Instead, the year-scale churning of plants upward, leaves downward, algae
      outward, that slow and ignorable recycling of the entire ground of our
      existence, choked its sensors and its solar panel.

      As I write this, the creek's shallow pools trickle languidly with what's
      left of last year's rain. The pile of trash under the bridge keeps
      growing. The shallow light no longers shines at the right angle to
      illuminate the
      <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/29664665">sculpin</a>

      Our dry November continues for now. This is the most difficult, uncertain,
      and dramatic time in California, a hundred thousand acres of predictable
      earthquakes.

    <p>
      All the annuals but the nichest natives are gone, every perennial's
      taproot stretched deep as possible, all but the last leaf dropped in a
      desperate attempt to make it to that first drop of rainfall. And when the
      rain does fall, these dry terrible ticks somehow sprout leaves anew.
